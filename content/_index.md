        I am a Research Data Analyst at the

        My work focuses on:

        • **Structural and social determinants of health**, including studies on  
          [housing and HIV service delivery outcomes](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39817941/),  
          [state-level funding environments](https://www.croiconference.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/posters/2024/1225.pdf),  
          [sexual risk stratification](Abstract_WEPEC157_2024.pdf).

        • **HIV prevention and treatment in China**, including  
          [regimen durability and modification](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41183094/),  
          [delayed treatment initiation](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37416802/),  
          cost-effectiveness analysis of [PrEP](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35801237/),  
          and [ART: ainuovirine versus efavirenz](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12044665/)

        • **Population size estimation** of key populations for  
          [The Global Fund](https://www.theglobalfund.org/),
          [MPact Global Action for Gay Men’s Health and Rights](https://mpactglobal.org/)

        • Creator of the open-source population size estimation and RDS visualization tool:  
          [REDCap RDS Tree Automata & SS-PSE](https://github.com/Yuanqi-Mi/REDCap-RDS-Tree-Automata-SSPSE-/)

        My research involves collaborations with partners globally to strengthen infectious disease response, 
        improve data quality, and advance tools that support equitable resource allocation.
